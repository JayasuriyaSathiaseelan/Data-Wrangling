# Data-Wrangling
# 📊 Data Wrangling Project

This repository, **data-wrangling**, showcases a comprehensive data analysis project focused on effective data preparation, exploration, and transformation techniques using **R**. The project demonstrates various data wrangling methods to clean, organize, and analyze datasets, providing valuable insights from raw data.

## 📄 Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to illustrate the process of **data wrangling**, which includes:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Applying statistical techniques and visualizations to uncover patterns and insights within the data.
3. **Data Transformation**: Reshaping, aggregating, and transforming data to better suit analytical needs.
4. **Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs to effectively communicate findings.

The project uses multiple datasets to demonstrate how to handle real-world data challenges, making it easier to extract meaningful insights and prepare data for machine learning or statistical analysis.
